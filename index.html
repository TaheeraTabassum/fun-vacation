                <h2>Our Popular Tours</h2>
                <p>Travelers’ Choice Awards Best of the Best winners are destinations whose hotels, restaurants and things to do received a high volume of above-and-beyond reviews and opinions from our community over a 12-month period.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Seoul is the business and cultural hub of South Korea, where skyscrapers tower over Buddhist temples. Take it all in from the N Seoul Tower, built atop a peak in Namsan Park.</li>
                    <li>Travelers visit Halong Bay for an up-close look at its amazing limestone islands, rock formations and caves. Whittled away over centuries by wind and water, they’re breathtaking.</li>
                    <li>Palawan is a slice of heaven, a sliver of an island that teems with exotic wildlife, quaint fishing villages, and UNESCO World Heritage Sites. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Fewer than 1% of Tripadvisor’s 8 million listings are awarded Best of the Best, signifying the highest level of excellence in travel. Congrats to all of the 2024 winners and a big thanks to the travelers who made it possible. From lesser-known cities to new escapes, these places are on the up and up. You heard it here first.
